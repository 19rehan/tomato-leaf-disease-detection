# 🍅 Tomato Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project applies **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to detect and classify **tomato leaf diseases** from images. Early detection of plant diseases is crucial for improving crop yield and reducing economic losses in agriculture.  

The model is trained on a dataset of tomato leaf images, covering multiple disease categories (e.g., Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Mold) as well as healthy leaves.

## 🚀 Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Resizing, normalization, and data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zoom).  
- **CNN Model**: Custom architecture built with TensorFlow/Keras.  
- **Multi-class Classification**: Predicts disease type or healthy leaf.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score.  
- **Visualization**: Training/validation curves and sample predictions.
